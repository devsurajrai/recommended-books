Hello ! this is my NeoGcamp practice application. This app basically is the application of react, it may not look very clean as i am just starting out and implementing whatever i learn along the way. 

## What is this app?

This app is a book recommendation app as the name suggests, provides you with the genre buttons and shows you the books based on your selection.
